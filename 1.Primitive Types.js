1.Primitive Types 
// In Javascript, a primative (primative value, primative data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods.
// The 6 primative data types are string, number, bigint, Boolean, undefined, and symbol. There is also null. 
// All primatives are immutable i.e., they cannot be altered. It is importantt not to confused a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primative value, 
// The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the exisiting value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.
// Basic Primitive data information is utilized as element storage; ie Numbers, Strings, Booleans. 
 
//1. Strings are used to represent text, "your name", can be represented in as a string in Syntax Language JavaScript.
//   Strings are identified by being a sequence of characters, which can include letters, numbers, puncuation & spaces.

//2. Numbers is a data type that can be multiplied, added, subtracted, and divided, as Javascript can perform basic mathematics. 

//3. A bilgnt value is an object primitive used to represent and manipulate primitive values, which are too large to be represented by the number primitive. 

//4. Booleans are expressions which can be passed to find value within a declared statement, whether the values are true or false.

//5. Undefined is one of the poperties of the global object, That is, a variable in global scope which holds an initial value of undefined being the primitive value undefined.

//6. Symbols are new primitive types introduced in ES6. Symbols are completely unique idetifiers; like their primitive counter parts(Number, String, Boolean).
// they can be created using the factory function Symbol which returns a Symbol.

//Null is usually stated when you want something to deliberately say "this is empty"
